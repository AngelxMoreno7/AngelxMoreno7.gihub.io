											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hi! I'm Angel, currently based in Anaheim, California. 
											I’ve recently graduated with my Masters in Statistics with emphasis in data science, 
											and I’m currently a data analyst at Trusted Tech Team. <br/>
											<br/>
											Personally, I'd like to say that I'm a well-rounded individual. I'm a career-driven academic, 
											but I'm also an easy-going person who enjoys spending quality time with loved ones, playing golf, and watching football. 
											I'm very optimistic and try to make the most of any situation that I find myself in. <br/>
											
											 <h2>Motivation</h2> <br/>
											Now of course, out of all career paths, why data science? Well, my absolute favorite part about this industry is that it isn't industry-specific. 
											No matter how much time I spend in a specific position, organization, or industry as a whole,
											I can easily carry my skills into a new environment with a more than fair chance at thriving. 
											I see this a perfect career for job security and of course, the compensation isn't bad for a first-generation individual seeking financial freedom. 
											I've enjoyed math since a young age and found programming extremely rewarding as an undergraduate, 
											so the mixture of calculus and programming involved in developing models makes this profession feel natural to me. <br/>
											<br/>
											Most of my personal projects are consumed by my hobbies. I have both collaborative and solo projects that cover fantasy football, scoring in the NBA, and the music industry. 
											The ideal industries I would like to work in are audio streaming or fantasy sports, but I've also taken a recent interest in automotives as most of my clients are EV manufacturers. 
											While my current role doesn't require these skills, I still find any reason to utilize them as I've developed dashboards, presented forecasts, and conducted analysis of production data.
